# ItemTrackingProject

## Summary of the Project
For my final project, I developed a program designed to manage and analyze the frequency of items from a given input file. The program solves the problem of counting item occurrences and presenting this information in multiple formats: a searchable list, a histogram, and a file output. This is particularly useful for tasks such as inventory management or scenarios where data frequency analysis is required.

## What I Did Well
I excelled in structuring the program into clear, distinct functions, such as:
- Searching for item frequencies.
- Displaying all items.
- Creating a histogram.
- Writing frequency data to a file.

This modular approach enhanced readability, ease of debugging, and testing. Additionally, I used a `map` container to track item frequencies accurately and efficiently.

## Areas for Improvement
There is room for enhancement in input validation and error handling. For example:
- Implementing more robust input validation to handle invalid menu choices.
- Optimizing file reading and processing for larger datasets.

These improvements would make the program more efficient and resilient to unexpected user inputs or anomalies in the data.

## Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging part of the project was implementing the histogram display function. Visualizing the data in a user-friendly format required careful consideration of formatting and iterating through the data. To overcome this, I:
1. Broke down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. Focused on iterating through the `map` container step-by-step.
3. Tested smaller code segments to ensure correctness.

## Tools and Resources
I relied on C++ standard library documentation and online resources to understand `map` usage and file input/output operations. To enhance my skills further, I plan to explore advanced debugging tools and study efficient data structures for future projects.

## Transferable Skills
This project helped me develop transferable skills, including:
- Breaking down complex problems into manageable components.
- Writing modular, reusable functions.
- Working with file input/output operations.
- Balancing functionality with user experience.

These skills will be invaluable in future coursework and professional projects.

## Program Maintainability
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I focused on:
- Using clear variable names.
- Maintaining consistent formatting.
- Writing modular functions to separate tasks logically.

This modular structure allows new features, such as additional analysis tools, to be added with minimal disruption to the existing code. Additionally, detailed comments and debugging output improved clarity and ease of future modifications.
